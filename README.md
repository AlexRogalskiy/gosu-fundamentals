# gosu-fundamentals
Programming fundamentals and common data structures implemented in Gosu

## Currently implemented data structures
1. Stack + Queue Interfaces (Stack.gs + Queue.gs)
    1. Linked List implementations for both (LinkedListStack.gs + LinkedListQueue.gs)
2. List Interface (List.gs)
    1. Linked List implementation (LinkedList.gs)
